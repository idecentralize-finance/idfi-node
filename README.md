The BOT project is a blockchain where transaction can activate an event in the physical world.

The RPC can handle incoming transaction and miners request but also offers a connection to a machine device. In the development phase we will use arduino. This will make it more accessible but the concept could be applied to a CNC machine that would produce an item on demand within a transaction. The era of overproduction is over.

We make use of Metamask to connect to the RPC. We also use patricia trie to validate block data. The project is meant to be an ethereum sidechain that               is a bridge between the virtual blockchain and the physical machine. 

Currently built for arduino micro controller for development purpose but the process can evolve to an industrial application where a good being produce by machine work would be payed directly to the machines owner account. Not only you will develop a smart contract to handle transactions but you will also use smart bytecode that will operate your machine based on a set of instruction encoded like smart contract.

Feel free to contact me for more info. this is the last phase of the idecentralize project and is in a proof of concept state at the moment. Many more hours of development are needed to bring this project to a release beta version.
