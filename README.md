The BOT project is a blockchain where transaction can activate an event in the physical world.

The RPC can handle incoming transaction and miners request but also offers a connection to a machine device. In the development phase we will use arduino. This will make it more accessible but the concept could be applied to a CNC machine that would produce an item on demand within a transaction. The era of overproduction is over.
